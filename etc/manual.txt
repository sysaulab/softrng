Below is the list of basic commands to play with. The IO descriptor indicate
if the command require an input or provide an output. By using simple shell 
pipe, we create combination of generator(s) entropy source(s) and all kind of
other fun things to observe.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INSTALL THE COMMANDS

To install the commands : sudo softrng install
To remove the commands  : sudo softrng remove
To view this manual     : sudo softrng mnual



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. KNOW THE COMMANDS

command  io  description
-------- --  ------------------------------------------------------------------
HEX      IO  display binary input in hexadecimal
INFO     IO  display binary input in hexadecimal
PRNG     IO  default pseudo rng generator
RAND      O  default system generator
RNG       O  complete solution using defaults, short for SEED|PRNG
SEED      O  software seedless generator (libICM)
SEEDY    IO  software seedless mixer (libICM)
STOP     IO  stop a stream after n bytes went through
VOID     I   sink to nothing, useful when benchmarking
ZERO      O  source of infinite zeros

3. PLAY WITH IT!


Important, read next line very carefully if you are new to the command line.
If you need to stop a command, type CTRL-C in the terminal running the command.


If you are not sure how this works, follow this tutorial. It will get you 
through the concepts one at a time with examples you can try yourself.

The commands are to be typed in your regular shell. Once installed, the short
default commands will be available to all users in all sessions. I think of
it as an extension of the shell. Basic knowledge of the shell is not necessary
but it is recommended.


COMMAND TYPED IN YOUR SHELL
    Description...


SEED
    SEED have an IO class of O. It means it do not require an stream to 
    function properly. The O indicates it is providing output. If the output is
    not captured it will be displayed on the screen raw binary form. Executing 
    this command can make your terminal do
    crazy things! Go ahead, give it a try!


SEED | HEX
    Display the strem generated by input converted in hexadecimal format.


ZERO | HEX
    Display enless zeros!


RAND | SIZE 1m > file.bin
    Get random numbers from /dev/random, limit the size of the stream to 
    1000000 bytes and save the content to a file: file.bin. 
    
    Note: If the file exist alrealy, it will be overwritten. To add data to an
    existing file, replace > with >>. There is no undo with this, everything
    is permanent, play with care!

    Try to change the "1m" with 1M and observe the precise file size of each one.


SEED | INFO | PRNG | VOID
    The INFO command will display information about the data going through it.
    INFO relay the information untouched with the minimal amount of overhead
    portably practical. In this configuration it will display the bandwidth
    used by the seeding node, not the output. 
    
    Can you change it to make it display information about final output?


Finally, you can try to edit the file in /etc/softrng. You can add your own 
modules, redefine default algorithms, even change this manual!

Remember, there is no undo and files get overwritten without warnings.
Use at your own risk.
