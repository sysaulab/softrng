DFEK is a USG(user-space seed generator) based on an unstable algorithm. 
At its core, it is 3 threads running a simple hashing algorithm that share its 
memory with neighbour threads. The result is complete chaos inside this small memory area
and allows to generate interesting random numbers to seed other algorithms 
using only userspace facilities.
